var passage = ["The four metal legs are a dark grey, anchored by more pieces of metal that are nailed around them to provide stability.",
    "The feet of the legs extend horizontally outward on the checkered floor—thin metal slabs anchored into the ground.",
    "From the legs upward, a sort of monstrous entity takes form.",
    "The screws and nail heads are visible where the armrest is attached to the body. The entire structure screams of an unyielding fortress.",
    "His head is bowed forward, hair covering his eyes as he stares with the world blocked out.",
    "His legs are angled apart in a natural, and in any other situation, comfortable position.",
    "Below his ankles are chained together, with raw red skin blooming from behind the black shackles, mirroring his wrists chained behind his back.",
    "His breaths unnoticeable, his eyes lost beneath his hair, his voice silenced—all this, as he sits in the middle of the black and white checkered floor.",
    "To a romantic, there are even splatters of red decorating the otherwise dull ground.",
    "To all the rest, blemishes of dull brown.",
    "Anticipation saturates the air as though expecting this scene so picturesque of an old, black and white photograph to suddenly blossom with colors—with spider lilies opening their petals one by one, fading out a limp, neutral white in favor of a brilliant red."
